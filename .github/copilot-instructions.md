This is a project for development of a game on C# using Godot 4 as game engine on `/src` folder.

The documentation is done in Docusaurus on `/docs` folder. 

Try to be brief in the code implementation and don't write code that already exists, unless explicitly asked for.

Focus in what needs to be added, changed or excluded.

When describing godot resources try to describe how them should be configured instead of writing the content of the file itself unless explicitly asked for.
