This is a project for development of a framework on C# using Godot 4 as game engine at `/src` folder.

The documentation is at `/docs` folder but don't suggest changes in the documentation.

Focus in what needs to be added, changed or excluded and be brief in the code implementation. Don't write code that already exists. 

When describing Godot resources, describe how them should be configured instead of writing the content of the file itself.
