This is a project for development of a game on C# using Godot 4 as game engine on `/src` folder.

The documentation is done in Docusaurus on `/docs` folder but any changes on this path should be avoided unless explicitly asked for. 

Try to be brief in the code implementation avoiding rewriting code that already exists, unless explicitly asked for and focus only in what needs to be added, changed or excluded.

If the suggestion requires a godot resource, don't reply with the content of the file itself unless explicitly asked for so, instead of this, try to describe how the resource should be configured.
